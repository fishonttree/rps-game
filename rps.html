    <!-- Okie dokes, what's the plan here? 
    
        1. God, uh...
        2. Button to start the game function (helps with "restarting")
        
        3. Starting the game's gonna toggle some elements into the DOM,
        producing some text and layout for the game to proceed in
        
        4. There will be three buttons for the options the user can click
        
        5. Clicking either of the three will input their corresponding 
        'choice' value into the game function. The game function should 
        evaluate the game state and return it through appending some text 
        element into the DOM.

        6. Best of 5 or first to 5 - either way, there should be the 
        option of replaying the game. By responding "no", the game UI 
        should toggled off, leaving the button to start
